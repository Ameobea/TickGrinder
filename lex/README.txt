This is an exploration of an experimental implementation of a custom-built scripting language for use in designing strategies for the Bot4 trading platform.  It's more for fun than anything else (there are much better ways of doing this than what's here) but it should be a fun excercise and may end up making things easier in the future.

I'm using .b4 files foor the platform's scripting language.  I'm not sure at this point whether I want the script to compile down to JavaScript, Rust, generate an executable list of commands in JSON, etc.
